# Predictza

 🎯 Objective

Predictza aims to bridge the gap between medical imaging and real-time diagnosis using machine learning. By automating the interpretation of ECG images, it empowers users and healthcare providers to identify potential heart conditions early and take preventive actions.

 🧬 How It Works

Image Validation: The uploaded ECG image undergoes validation to ensure it's a proper ECG scan.

Metadata Extraction: The app analyzes ECG wave patterns to extract meaningful features (e.g., ST elevation, Q waves).

Prediction Engine: A voting classifier—an ensemble of multiple machine learning models—predicts the type of heart disease.

Personalized Output: Users receive:

Disease diagnosis

Visual metadata breakdown

Customized medical precautions

A downloadable PDF report

User Management: All user details, predictions, and appointments are stored securely in a local database.

 🏥 Real-World Use Cases

Remote Cardiac Screening: Ideal for telemedicine platforms that require automated diagnostics.

Clinical Support Tool: Assists cardiologists in preliminary screening of patients.

Health Checkup Camps: Can be used during community outreach programs where rapid ECG scanning and feedback are needed.

Educational Tool: Medical students can use it to understand ECG features and disease classification.

 🔍 Model Insights

The app integrates multiple models to improve prediction accuracy:

Random Forest: Helps with feature importance and non-linear decision making.

XGBoost: Offers optimized gradient boosting for robust learning.

CatBoost: Especially good with categorical features and prevents overfitting.

Voting Classifier: Combines predictions from all models to make a consensus decision—balancing strengths and weaknesses.

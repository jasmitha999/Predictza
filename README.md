# PREDICTZA

🎯 Objective
Predictza aims to bridge the gap between medical imaging and real-time diagnosis using machine learning. By automating the interpretation of ECG images, it empowers users and healthcare providers to identify potential heart conditions early and take preventive actions.

🧬 How It Works
Image Validation: The uploaded ECG image undergoes validation to ensure it's a proper ECG scan.

Metadata Extraction: The app analyzes ECG wave patterns to extract meaningful features (e.g., ST elevation, Q waves).

Prediction Engine: A voting classifier—an ensemble of multiple machine learning models—predicts the type of heart disease.

Personalized Output: Users receive:

Disease diagnosis

Visual metadata breakdown

Customized medical precautions

A downloadable PDF report

User Management: All user details, predictions, and appointments are stored securely in a local database.

🏥 Real-World Use Cases
Remote Cardiac Screening: Ideal for telemedicine platforms that require automated diagnostics.

Clinical Support Tool: Assists cardiologists in preliminary screening of patients.

Health Checkup Camps: Useful in community outreach programs for quick ECG scans and reports.

Educational Tool: Helps medical students understand ECG features and disease classification.

🔍 Model Insights
The app integrates multiple models to improve prediction accuracy:

Random Forest: Helps with feature importance and non-linear decision making.

XGBoost: Offers optimized gradient boosting for robust learning.

CatBoost: Excellent for handling categorical features and reducing overfitting.

Voting Classifier: Combines predictions from all models to make a balanced consensus decision.
